# Cache Benchmarks

Here we store all benchmarks run organized by cache type and date for all cache implementations.
All cache benchmarks have the environment they were run in and the overall results of the benchmark.

### Contirbutions

Contributions are **expected** when contributions to any cache implementation are given. Please 
execute a benchmark run in your environment before and after changes and post results. 
Benchmark markdown files should have in the file name the date of the run and (if applicable) the
PR associated with the benchmark. 

\**If associated with a PR, there should be three sections:**

- Environment
This is the environment that you are running the benchmarks in. When running the benchmark project, it will be the first section under ```* Summary *```
- Current
These are the current results when running benchmarks against the main branch (before your changes)
- Results
These are the benchmarks following the changes you have implemented
